## Introduction

It's common as a web developer to receive digital assets with solid color backgrounds. The background of an image asset often needs to be made transparent so that it doesn't clash with the existing design of a page. Normally you have to use a tool like Photoshop to manually remove the background.

This tool will allow you to upload an image for the purpose of removing that background and making it transparent. 

I'm going to use a machine learning model trained to detect the background area of an image.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
